# Vaccine Appointment Project

This project was made during the global pandemic, and it's objective was to be able to make a vaccine appointment with a (fake)hospital.

## The project

This project was made using ReactJS/Bootstrap for the front-end part, and NodeJS/Express/MongoDB for the backend. It was a challenge made by the company i now work on as a intern,
so some rules were made for it to be competitive.

## The rules
The rules for it were:
- The appointment must be made in a page, using a form :white_check_mark:
- There are only 20 available spaces per day :white_check_mark:
- There are only 2 available spaces per hour :white_check_mark:
- There must be a way to consult the appointments that were made :white_check_mark:
- The consulting page must be ordered by day and hour :white_check_mark:
- The "Nurse" must be capable of checking if the "pacient" has been attended, and leave a comment about it :white_check_mark:
- When F5ing, the data must not be lost :white_check_mark:

## Changes for the project in the future:
I plan to make this project bigger and better, fixing stuff i don't like. For instance, the front-end design and usage is really scuffed, so i want to improve that. I like how the back-end is working, but it should have even more improvement in the future
