# Vaccine Appointment Project

This project was made during the global pandemic, and it's objective was to be able to make a vaccine appointment with a (fake)hospital.

## The project

This project was made using ReactJS/Bootstrap for the front-end part, and NodeJS/Express/MongoDB for the backend. It was a challenge made by the company i now work on as an intern, so some rules were made for it to be competitive.

## The rules
The rules for it were:
- The appointment must be made in a page, using a form :white_check_mark:
- There are only 20 available spaces per day :white_check_mark:
- There are only 2 available spaces per hour :white_check_mark:
- There must be a way to consult the appointments that were made :white_check_mark:
- The consulting page must be ordered by day and hour :white_check_mark:
- The "Nurse" must be capable of checking if the "pacient" has been attended, and leave a comment about it :white_check_mark:
- When F5ing, the data must not be lost :white_check_mark:

## Changes for the project in the future:
My intention is to scale up and improve this project by addressing some of its current shortcomings. Specifically, I plan on revamping the front-end design and usability, which is currently lacking. Although the back-end is functioning well, I still aim to enhance its performance for optimal results. Ultimately, my objective is to optimize the project's overall functionality and user experience, with the ultimate goal of creating a more polished and satisfying final product.
